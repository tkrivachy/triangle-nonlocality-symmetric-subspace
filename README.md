# triangle-nonlocality-symmetric-subspace
Computational appendix for the work on exploring local hidden variable models in the fully symmetric subspace of the triangle network.

## Data and code for the NN-inspired Bell-type inequality
Include w, delta_w pairs I found for l=1,2, and python script to evaluate the inequality.
$w * s_111(P) + (1-w) Delta(P) <= delta_W$

## Data for almost symmetric classical strategy with s_111 > 0.25
Include data and a python script to plot it.


## Mathematica code
